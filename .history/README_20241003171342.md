# Better Todo

Building the to-do app I've always dreamed about. This project aims to create a simple, minimalist to-do app that addresses the shortcomings of existing, overly complicated task management solutions.

## Why Better Todo?

Most to-do list apps on the market are packed with features that often overcomplicate the simple task of managing your daily activities. Better Todo takes a different approach:

- **Simplicity First**: A clean, minimalist interface that puts your tasks front and center.
- **All-in-One View**: See all your tasks in one place, helping you achieve more without switching between multiple views or categories.
- **Gamification**: Added fun elements to make task completion more engaging and rewarding.
- **Pomodoro Integration**: (Planned) Built-in Pomodoro timer to help you focus and manage your work sessions effectively.

The goal is to create a daily work companion that keeps you productive without the unnecessary complexity.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
